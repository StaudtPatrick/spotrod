This directory contains five different implementations of a simple function
used in spotrod, along with a Makefile and a test.py to do benchmarking. The
purpose of this is to justify the choice of C for the final product. The five
implementations are:

toypython.py: in Python, using a loop or indexing arrays with Boolean masks;
toycython.pyx: in Cython, using a loop or indexing arrays with Boolean masks;
toyc.c: in C, using a loop.

There are *-setup.py files for the Cython and C version, as well toyc-wrapper.c
for interfacing C with numpy.
