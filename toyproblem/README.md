# spotrod/toyproblem

This directory contains five different implementations of a simple function
used in [spotrod](../spotrod), along with a Makefile and a test.py to do benchmarking. The purpose of this is to justify the choice of C for the final product. The five implementations are:

toypython.py: in Python, using a loop or indexing arrays with Boolean masks;
toycython.pyx: in Cython, using a loop or indexing arrays with Boolean masks;
toyc.c: in C, using a loop.

There are \*-setup.py files for the Cython and C version, as well toyc-wrapper.c for interfacing C with numpy.
 
## TODO

For the upcoming Code Coffee presentation, I should create a short slide show and an ipython-notebook.
